\item{\textbf{Signum phase mask.} The imaging system shown in Figure \ref{fig:f1} is illuminated by an on-axis plane wave at wavelength $\lambda=\SI{1}{\mu \meter}$. }

\caption{Lenses L1, L2 are identical with sufficiently large aperture and focal length $f=\SI{10}{c\metre}$. The pupil mask M has aperture $a=\SI{1}{c\metre}$. Inside the aperture there is a piece of glass of refractive index $n=1.5$. The glass has been partially etched to form a step of height $s=\SI{1}{\mu \metre}$, and the step is precisely aligned with the optical axis, as shown.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Sketch the amplitude transfer function (AFT) of this optical system.}

\item{A thin transparency with amplitude transmission function}
$$g_t(x)=\cos \left( 2\pi \frac{x}{\SI{20}{\mu \metre} } \right)$$ 
is placed at the object plane. Sketch the magnitude and phase of the transparency $g_t(x)$.

\item{With the transparency $g_t(x)$ in place at the object plane, the system is illuminated with a plane wave on-axis. What is the optical field at the image plane?}

\item{With the same transparency $g_t(x)$ in place at the object plane, the system is illuminated with a plane wave off-axis, propagating at an angle of +0.1rad with respect to the optical axis. What is the optical field at the image plane?}

\item{Suggest an intuitive description of the system's operation under spatially coherent, on-axis plane wave illumination (as in question c)}.
